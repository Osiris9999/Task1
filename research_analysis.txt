Nmap and wireshark act as powerful utilities in scanning networks and finding vulnerabilities through open ports.

Nmap is used for network discovery while Wireshark is used for packet analysis.

Port analysis

21 - Used by the File Transfer Protocol[FTP] for client server connections and is crucial for file transfer.

22 - Used for the Secure Shell protocol used for secure remote access of devices.

23 - Used by the Telnet protocol which helps in obtaining remote access through command line interface. Very vulnerable since it transfers data in plain text.

53 - Used for the Domain Name System protocol used for translating domain names into IP addresses.

80 - Used for HTTP communication which is crucial for web browsing. It handles unencrypted data so this makes eavesdropping easier.

5060 - Used for Session Initiation Protocol used in VoIP.

Most common attacks against ssh include Brute-force, insecure ssh key login, man in the middle attacks.
